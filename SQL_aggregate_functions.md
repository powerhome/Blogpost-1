#The Power of SQL Aggregate Functions

Throughout my first few months, there has been so many topics we had to cover from basic Ruby conditionals and iterations, to more complex topics such as Ruby class relationships, Scraper CLIs and ORMs. Personally, I enjoy data manipulation to see if I can spot common trends and make my own deductions based on the resulting data. Nothing encapsulates that better than SQL.

SQL is a domain-specific language and is the standard language for relational database management systems. It's a very powerful tool when it comes to data  management, but for the sake of this blog we will focus on one aspect of SQL, **aggregate functions**. We will be diving deeper into some basic functions:
1. SUM
2. AVG
3. COUNT
4. MAX
5. MIN
